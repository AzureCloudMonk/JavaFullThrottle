         1. Expression format shown here may not contain return.
         2. Can also use this format as a standalone statement.
         3. Cases with -> cannot fall through to the next case.
         4. Can still use cases with :, which do allow fallthrough.
         5. Cases may contain a block of code, in which case you use yield
            to specify the case's value.
         6. Cases support individual values or comma-separated lists of values
            of integer types, enum types or Strings.
         7. Eventually, there will be pattern matching support. See
            http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/pattern-match.html 
         8. More future language enhancements: https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/
